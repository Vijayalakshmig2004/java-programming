1.Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members- length and breadth and a function to calculate the area which is 'length*breadth'. 
The class has three constructors which are :
1 - Having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.
2 - Having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadthrespectively.
3 - Having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number.
Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters and print their areas.

import java.util.*;
class rect
{
	rect()
	{
		int l = 0;
		int b = 0;
		System.out.println("area of rectangle without parameter : " +(l*b));
	}
	rect(int l , int b)
	{
		System.out.println("area of rectangle with 2 parameter : " +(l*b));
	}
	rect(int s)
	{
		System.out.println("area of rectangle with one parameter : " +(s*s));
	}
}
class conrectangle
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		rect r = new rect();
		rect r1 = new rect(5);
		rect r2 = new rect(4,5);
	}
}



2.Suppose you have a Piggie Bank with an initial amount of $50 and you have to add some more amounts to it. Create a class 'AddAmount' with a data member 
named 'amount' with an initial value of $50. Now make two constructors of this class as follows:
1 - without any parameter - no amount will be added to the Piggie Bank
2 - having a parameter which is the amount that will be added to the Piggie Bank
Create an object of the 'AddAmount' class and display the final amount in the Piggie Bank
import java.util.*;
class Amo
{
	int a = 50;
	Amo()
	{
		System.out.println("piggie bank account without parameter : " +(a));
	}
	Amo(int amount)
	{
		System.out.println("piggie bank account with parameter : " +(amount+a));
	}
}
class conaddamount
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Amo r = new Amo();
		Amo r1 = new Amo(1000);
	}
}

3.Create a class to print the area of a square and a rectangle. The class has two functions with the same name but different number of parameters. 
The function for printing the area of rectangle has two parameters which are its length and breadth respectively while the other function for printing 
the area of square has one parameter which is the side of the square.

import java.util.*;
class area
{
	area(int l , int b)
	{
		System.out.println("area of rectangle : " +(l*b));
	}
	area(int s)
	{
		System.out.println("area of square : " +(s*s));
	}
}
class conarea
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		area r = new area(4,5);
		area r1 = new area(6);
	}
}

4.Write a program to print the names of students by creating a Student class. If no name is passed while creating an object of the Student class, 
then the name should be "Unknown", otherwise the name should be equal to the String value passed while creating the object of the Student class.

import java.util.*;
class stu 
{
	stu()
	{
		String name = "unknown";
		System.out.println("Student name without parameter : " +name);
	}
	stu(String name)
	{
		System.out.println("Student name with parameter : " +name);
	}
}
class constudent
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		stu r = new stu();
		stu r1 = new stu("tanuja");
	}
}
